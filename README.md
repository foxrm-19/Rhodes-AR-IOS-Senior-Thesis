# Rhodes-AR-IOS-Senior-Thesis
Using tools such as Mapbox and Vuforia, we created an augmented reality IOS application in Unity that allows users to interact with objects placed in specific GPS locations.  When touch is detected on an object, information about that location is shared with the user.  
*Note* Due to several packages, the entire project is quite large.  In order to manage that for now, we are only uploading our developed scripts and objects.

For captured images of the project in use on an IOS phone, look at issues 1-7
